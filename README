Android NameThat version 1.2 beta

Android NameThat is a port of the popular catch phrase game for iOS called NameThat.
This port adds the ability to add/edit/delete words from the list.
Future versions will allow add/edit/delete of categories.

NOTES:

Android NameThat uses iOS NameThat's word and category list database.  Because it has not been released under an open source license I cannot include it in this project.  Therefore there is no namethat.db by default and this application will not work without one.
The license issue should be taken care of soon or a new database will be build from scratch.
